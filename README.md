I am writing this letter to claim my interest in working as an internship in an motivated
environment. During my academic path I always tried to learn new thing and good part of
working as an intern is that I can use all these skills in real world.
I have two years of experience in financial market in Capital Market Development Fund as
apprentice for the first year and as an official researcher for the rest of my experience in there I
was preparing and analysing the data. But since I was interested in Money market and itâ€™s
relation and connection to financial market along with my interest being a better and
professional place I started my job as a member of a research team in Ministry of Economic
Affairs and Finance working mainly on cleaning data and visualization and preparing report
for Economics ministry of affairs in Iran.
In addition of having experience in different places I have achieved experience of doing team
work and some extra skills of using R and python and being professional of using stata after
passing one year course base program at University of Calgary and passing courses such as ,
Machin Learning with R and python and Econometrics in master and P.h.D level.
Being in an environment to develop these skills and learn more by doing would be a great
opportiunity for me and it will perepare me to start my professional career.
Enclosed is my resume, which provides further details about my qualifications and experiences.
